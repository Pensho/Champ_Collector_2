In a vibrant fantasy world, a cartoonist style illustration of two people, one using a trident to smack down in a swift motion onto an axe dropped by the other person, now having their hand open. The trident sticking in from the right side over the frame and the axe from the left, ending near the middle and hiding the rest of the two persons except for their arms and leather gloved hands, is set against a blurry background of a battle and large parts sky to create a contrast between the axe and background, with daylight casting a warm glow on the scene, emphasizing the the speed of the trident coming down onto the axe, saturated colors and dynamic, as the surrounding environment fades into a dreamy haze.
