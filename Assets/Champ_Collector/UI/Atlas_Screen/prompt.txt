In a vibrant fantasy world, a cartoonist style illustration of a breathtaking, wide-angle fantasy concept art of a grasslands vista from the perspective of a high up elevated stone balcony and railing with a staircase winding down into the distance. There are three highlight locations in the far distance:
* In the center, a long windy road leading towards snowy mountains.
* To the left, in the far distance three huge regal old stone statues made of slate stone depicting different humanoid creatures stand around in a circle. Each with one clearly distinguishing piece of bright red equipment; Weapon, Shield and Boots.
* To the right of the mountain road there is a colorful large caravan, holding many wares, waiting to head towards some cliff riddled shores.
Lastly there is a notice board located to the right on the balcony itself, riddled with unreadable paper notes what seem to be quests for adventurers to take.
Artistic style is lush, detailed, and painterly.
