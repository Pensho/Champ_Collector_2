In a vibrant fantasy world, a cartoonist style illustration of a wide-angle, high-detail fantasy concept art, designed as a hub of a clandestine pirate base built into a massive, vertically-oriented sea cave. The scene is organized into three four distinct functional zones:

* The Lowest Tier (The Adventurer’s Guild): A rowdy, lantern-lit tavern at the water's edge where pirates and mercenaries recruit new characters.
* The Second Tier (The War Room): A central stone overlook featuring a massive, tattered map table used to plan campaign missions and daily events.
* The Third Tier (The Shop): A "Black Market" stall tucked into a side grotto, filled with crates of glowing reagents, exotic trinkets, and rare consumables for sale.
* The Highest Tier (The Armory): A forge built into the cavern’s upper cliffs, where players manage gear, upgrade skills, and refine item affixes.

Composition & Style: The tiers are connected by precarious rope bridges, pulley elevators, and stone stairs, emphasizing extreme verticality. Moonlight pours through a jagged opening at the very top, clashing with the warm, smoky orange glow of the forge and the green-tinted lanterns of the shop. Hand-painted digital illustration style, isometric perspective, rich textures of damp stone and weathered wood.
