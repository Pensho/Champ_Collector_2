In a vibrant fantasy world, a cartoonist style illustration of a medieval spear, sticking up from the bottom left corner going diagonally over the frame ending in near the middle and hiding the rest of the holder except for their arm and leather gloved hand, is set against a blurry background of a battle and large parts sky to create a contrast between the spear and background, with daylight casting a warm glow on the scene, emphasizing the the spears sharp point, saturated colors and dynamic, as the surrounding environment fades into a dreamy haze. In the perspective of someone facing the holder and slightly from below.
